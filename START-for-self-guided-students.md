### Step 1: Make sure we can help!

Check out the [target audience]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/audience) of the course 
and decide if you will benefit from interacting with these materials. If you are 
a food producer or consumer at any educational level that wants to make a 
difference in your community, then you are likely our target audience. You can find a little more encouragement in our description of [why you should take this workshop]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/why-should-you-take-this-workshop/).

### Step 2: Decide your approach to the workshop.

As a self-guided student you can 1) follow along with the whole workshop at your own pace or 2) find a couple modules that will be helpful to you in isolation. 
If you are following the whole course, we suggest you follow the [schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule). Each [segment]({{ site.baseurl }}/segments) includes listings for resource materials and [activities]({{ site.baseurl }}/activities). 

### Step 3: Give us feedback

Help us make sure you have a good experience by [providing feedback]({{ site.github.repo }}/issues) or [contacting us](mailto:brymz@ufl.edu).
