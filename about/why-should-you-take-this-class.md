title: Why should you take this workshop?
---

Because [we should invest more in the transition to sustainable agriculture](https://www.ucsusa.org/food-agriculture/advance-sustainable-agriculture/counting-on-agroecology).

Because international agriculture and development groups have recognized the
importance of agroecology([FAO](http://www.fao.org/family-farming/themes/agroecology/en/), [SARE](https://www.sare.org/Learning-Center/Books/Manage-Insects-on-Your-Farm/Text-Version/Recent-Advances-in-Ecological-Pest-Management/Agroecological-Strategies-to-Enhance-On-Farm-Insect-Pollinators), [Groundswell International](https://www.groundswellinternational.org/approach/agroecological-farming/))

Because the evidence increasingly says so:
- [Pretty and Hine, 2001](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/oct/09/agroecological-farming-feed-world-africa)
- [National Research Council, 2010](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/12832/toward-sustainable-agricultural-systems-in-the-21st-century)
- [Rodale Institute, 2014](https://rodaleinstitute.org/assets/WhitePaper.pdf)


And because [students really like it]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/praise), 
*we hope*.
