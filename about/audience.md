The long-term goal of this site is to help two large groups of people:
1) Extension agents and state specialists who are interested in integrating
agriculture, natural resource management, and social development in their
programming; and 2) people who produce and consume food and want to be more aware of the environmental and societal consequences of their decisions. We are
starting with the Extension folks, specifically through a 1.5 day workshop, or
in-service training and then will attempt to build on that material to make it
maximally useful to the broader audience.
