Thanks everyone for introducing yourselves. We're going to give the instructors 
and hosts and extra opportunity to introduce themselves in a little more
detail by going further into how they got involved in agroecology and why they
have chosen to stick around.

1. Robert Kluson
2. Lloyd Singleton
3. Roy Beckford
4. Zack Brym
5. Betsey Boughton
6. Hilary Swain

Hilary will also take a extra few minutes to introduce us to the Archbold
Biological Station, Buck Island Ranch, and their cohesive set of goals across
agriculture and natural resources.
