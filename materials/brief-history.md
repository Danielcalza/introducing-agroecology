### Agronomy and Ecology


Ecology = study of natural systems (pure science)

Agronomy = study of agriculture (applied science)

Earliest combination 
- "crop ecology" (1920s)
- where crops were grown and their optimal 
ecological conditions
– 1928; K.Klages; “Crop ecology & geography” 
– 1939; H.Hanson; “Ecology in agriculture’

Early agriculture defined by fertilizer limitation
- Von Leibig vs. H

### Agriculture and Ecology Divergess

- WWII happens and a new process emerges for making explosives
- The Haber-Bosch process also happens to be good for fertilizer
– Ecology moved more into pure science direction
– Agronomy = moved into mechanization and Ag chemicals development

### Recombination

- Late 1950s; Maturing of the ecosystem concept in ecology prompted renewed
interest in crop ecology & a framework for examining agriculture
– 1956; G.Azzi; “Agricultural ecology” 
- 1960s and 1970s; environmental awareness
- population & community ecology -> systems research

Short History of Agroecology

1980s 
–
1990s

Agroecology emerged as a distinct methodology for 
the study of agroecosystems

concepts”

Sustainable Agriculture

Short History of Agroecology

2000s 
–
Present

Agroecology expanded as a strategy for global 
agroecosystems sustainability

interdisciplinarity”

systems”

sustainable food systems

Eugene Odum, 
Introduction to 
Ecology
text (1953)
•
Defined ecology as the structure 
and function of ecosystems
•
Influenced by others developing ideas of 
energy flow and nutrient cycles, which he 
systematized and explained well
•
Formulated the concept of emergent 
properties of ecosystems
•
Heavily influenced by brother, Howard, an 
Electrical Engineer

Short History of Ecosystem Science

C.S. 
Holling
•
He first introduced in 1973 the concept 
of resiliency in order to describe the 
persistence of natural systems in the 
face of changes in ecosystem variables 
due to natural or anthropogenic causes
