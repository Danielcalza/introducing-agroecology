1. Consider the goals of agroecology. What progress has your system made to
improve the outcomes of each of the main goals of agroecology (production,
environment, society)? By intuition, give your system a score for each goal.

2. Consider the linkages you drew on your agroecosystem diagram in [Know Your Agroecosystem]({{ site.baseurl }}/activities/The-agroecosystems-concept-know-your-agroecosystem-Intro), step 2.
Are there specific management practices or interventions that have improved the 
sustainability of the system through strengthening or weakening those linkages?
What linkages would you focus on the improve the agroecosystem-oriented score?
How does your assessment of the system change when you look at the extended
system from [Know Your Agroecosystem]({{ site.baseurl }}/activities/The-agroecosystems-concept-know-your-agroecosystem-Intro), step 3.
