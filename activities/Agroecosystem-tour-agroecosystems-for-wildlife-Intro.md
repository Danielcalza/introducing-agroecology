*This is an optional activity to help foster discussion around the tour.*

- Keep a list of the plants and animals that you see at Buck Island Range. 
- Can you distinguish plants and animals by habitat? Which contribute to the 
agroecosystem? Which are just 'passing by'? 
- Consider the value of agriculture as a refuge or corridor for wildlife.
