1. You drew a general diagram of an agroecosystem on side 1 of your poster
paper. Now, think about an agroecosystem that represents the work that you do 
and draw an agroecosystem diagram that represents your agroecosystem on side 3.

2. Draw some arrows on your agroesystem that represents the linkages of the 
players in your agroecosystem. Are these linkages that you can manage?

3. Think about what extends beyond (or below) your agroecosystem. Add some
players and linkages to your agroecosystem using the space you left on side 2.
Can you draw a whole new/complementary system?
