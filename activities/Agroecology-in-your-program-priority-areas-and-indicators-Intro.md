The [Workload Indicators Table](http://pdec.ifas.ufl.edu/workload/WorkloadIndicatorsContacts.pdf)
is the exhaustive list of the information gathered by IFAS PDEC to determine
the impacts of our Extension programs.

1. Browse through the list and highlight all of the indicator questions that
can be targeted using a program related to agroecology.
2. Identify each of these indicators by the goals of agroecology (production, 
environment, society).
3. Tally up your results for each of the goals.
4. Get together with a small group of 3-4 people to compare results.
