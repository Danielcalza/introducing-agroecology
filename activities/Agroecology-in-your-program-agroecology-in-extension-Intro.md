This is our opportunity to develop and plan for some deliverables from this
workshop, so let's brainstorm as a group possible programs and outcomes that
we can plan for in the future.

- Who wants to help the organizers prepare EDIS documents from these materials?
- Who wants to develop a follow-up program for our Extension audience? 
- Who wants to plan an opportunity for the combination of two existing programs?
- Who wants to develop a whole new program for a public audience?
